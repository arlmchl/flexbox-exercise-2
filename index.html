            For her 19th life, she begins to live as Ban Ji-Eum (Shin Hye-Sun). Whenever she is reborn, from age 8 to age 12, 
            she begins to remember all of her previous lives. After that, she lives her life with memories from all of her previous lives. 
            She hates remembering all her of previous lives and whenever she faces the end of her life, she hopes that she will never be reborn or remember her previous lives. 
            In her 18th life, when she was Yoon Joo-Won and 12 years old, she met a kid named Mun Seo-Ha. They became very close. 
            In her current 19th life and as Ban Ji-Eum, she again meets Mun Seo-Ha (Ahn Bo-Hyun). He is now all grown up. 
            Ban Ji-Eum is fully aware of whoMun Seo-Ha is and approaches him with affection.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Meanwhile, when Mun Seo-Ha was a kid, he lost people that he loved, including his first love Yoon Joo-Won. 
            Since then, he has refused to have relationships with other people. 
            His life changes due to the appearance of the strange woman named Ban Ji-Eum.
